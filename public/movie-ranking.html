<h3>Bahubali:2 The Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are way too many things that impress you in Baahubali 2 but it is practically impossible to pen all of them down in this review. Let me start by talking about the gigantic scale of the film. It is like a never before and never again kind of scenario as Baahubali 2 is huge in every aspect. Every visual of the film is filled with surprises either in terms of graphics or the extravagant sets that have been put up. The costumes, drama showcased and performances are a first of its kind in film.</p>
<h3>Bahubali 1</h3>
<p>Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clichéd was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful..</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>The most eagerly anticipated film of the year with arguably India’s most beloved director at its helm thankfully largely lives up to the hype, delivering a visual treat that is sure to take your breath away if experienced in theatres. SS Rajamouli has two ideal foils in Junior NTR and Ram Charan, who take his spectacular cinematic vision and deliver magnificent lead performances that will keep you hooked for the entire 3 hour plus running time..</p>
